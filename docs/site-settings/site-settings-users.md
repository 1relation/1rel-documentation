## User Actions

For each user in the list, the following actions are available:

- **Login as user**: Temporarily access 1Relation as the selected user to troubleshoot or provide support.
- **Reset password and send new login mail**: If a user has trouble logging in, you can send them a password reset email.
- **Edit user**: Modify user details or group assignments.
- **Archive user**: Temporarily disable user access without deleting their account. Archived users can be reactivated later.

After making changes to a user's account or group assignments, ensure you **"SAVE"** to apply the updates.
