# Introduction

Welcome to the initial setup guide for managing site settings within 1Relation. This section is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to navigate and utilize the site settings, which is a fundamental step in customizing and configuring your 1Relation site to align with your business operations.

## Starting With An Empty Site

When you first create a site on 1Relation, you have the option to start with an empty site or to select a template that pre-configures the system for you. We will begin with an **empty site** to demonstrate how to configure your site from the ground up.
