# Configuration Guide

A concise guide to configuring the FlowAgent platform, whether you prefer no-code UI or low-code JSON.

## When to Use
Read this page if you want to adjust how FlowAgent works for your business or need to understand configuration options.

## How It Works
- **No-Code / UI Configuration:**
  - Most settings (modules, tabs, widgets, etc.) can be configured directly in the UI by filling out fields.
  - If you need help with a field, check the documentation for a detailed explanation.
- **Low-Code Configuration:**
  - Some advanced or new features require low-code configuration using JSON.
  - The editor provides suggestions and error checking to help you write valid JSON.
  - Example use cases: custom logic, advanced automations, or features not yet available in the UI.

## Tips
- If you’re unsure, start with the UI. Only use low-code when necessary.
- Don’t hesitate to use tools like Copilot or ChatGPT for help with JSON formatting.
- Search the documentation for examples and explanations.
