# Understanding the Documentation

A quick guide to navigating and using the FlowAgent documentation effectively.

## When to Use
Read this page if you are new to the documentation or want to find information quickly.

## How It Works
- The sidebar is organized to match the Flow platform: Sites and Modules, each with their own subpages (e.g., Sites contains actional buttons, plugins, etc.; Modules contains custom fields, relations, etc.).
- Use the search function (top right) to find topics by keyword.
- Documentation is updated regularly with new examples and guides.

## Usage Example
**Searching for a topic:**
- Type a keyword (e.g., "custom field") in the search bar.
- Review the suggested pages and select the most relevant one.

## Tips
- If you can't find what you need, try different keywords or check related sections.
- Every JSON/code page includes at least one example for clarity.
