# Understanding the documentation

Our documentation is structured how the Flow platform is build.

In the sidebar you will find Sites and Modules. Under each you will find what they contain (sites contains actional buttons, plugins etc. and modules contains customfields, relations etc.)

That being said, we suggest you get friends with our search function in the top right. Our hope is that the search function can find you what you need, just by writing in keywords what you are trying to do.

To be able to do this, we are constantly evolving our documentation with new examples of how to do different things. This should help you to find what you need.
