# Show relevant forms

Sometimes we donÂ´t know what form to be displayed, as this is setup as a "relvant form". This is a form that is relevant to the current item, and is setup in the form configuration. This is a way to show the relevant form.

| Property | Type   | Required | Description |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| `itemKey`| string | No       | The key of the item to be used in the form as the main item. |
| `items`  | array  | No       | In some situations, you need to pass an item you need, but cannot get outside the Actional Button context. In this array you can pass any items you need |
