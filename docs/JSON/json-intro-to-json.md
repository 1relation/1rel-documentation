# JSON in 1Relation

Welcome to the JSON documentation for 1Relation. This section aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is utilized within the 1Relation system. JSON, known for its lightweight and easy-to-use structure, is a cornerstone in our system for various configuration and data handling processes.

## What is JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a language-independent data format. Originating from the programming language JavaScript, it has become a widely accepted standard for data interchange. JSON is built on two primary structures:
- A collection of name/value pairs, often represented as objects.
- An ordered list of values, usually appearing as arrays.
