## Purpose of Actions in Actional buttons

Actions in Actional buttons are designed to:

1. **Automate Tasks**: Execute tasks like CRUD operations automatically, enhancing efficiency in data management.
2. **Enhance User Interaction**: Trigger forms and display notifications, ensuring a responsive and engaging user experience.
3. **Streamline Workflows**: Seamlessly integrate with system workflows, triggering necessary actions in response to user interactions with Actional buttons.

## Basic Structure of an Action

Actions are defined by conditions (`if`) and the tasks to be executed (`then`).

| Property | Type  | Required | Description |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `if`     | array | No       | A set of criteria that determine when the action should be triggered. These criteria can involve item states, user roles, or other contextual data. |
| `then`   | object| Yes      | Defines the tasks or operations to be performed when the action is triggered. This can include CRUD operations, opening forms, and more. |

## Examples of Actions in Actional buttons

### Basic Action Configuration

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "Mark Task as Complete",
      "if": [
        ["taskStatus", "!=", "Completed"]
      ],
      "then": {
        "crud": {
          "update": {
            "task": {
              "customfield": {
                "cf445": "Completed"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Then Object
Actional Button has a `then` object that contains the tasks or operations to be performed when the action is triggered. This can include CRUD operations, opening forms, and more.
