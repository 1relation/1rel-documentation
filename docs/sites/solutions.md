# Solutions

Solutions are snips of configurations that makes it easy to get prebuilt functionality easy. Think of it as a set of lego blocks already put together. You can simple copy the already prebuilt lego blocks and get going from there. The smart thing about solutions is that when the author of the solution updates the solution, you will instantly get the same changes, allowing your site to always be updated.

:::note
Solutions has not been implemented yet, therefor there are no available documentation yet. Expected to be implemented end of Q2 2025.
