# Organisations

A guide to managing external organisations and their users in FlowAgent.

## When to Use
Use this page when you want to add vendors, customers, or other external parties to your site with limited access.

## How It Works
- **Organisation Groups:**
  - Create or select an organisation group before adding users.
  - Best practice: Have both a global group (for shared permissions) and a company-specific group.
- **Organisation Users:**
  - Users created in an organisation group have access only to data relevant to their group.
  - Organisation users appear in the Invited or Active tab, just like regular users.

## Usage Example
**Creating an external organisation user:**
1. Go to the Organisation tab in Site Settings.
2. Select or create an organisation group.
3. Click the users icon, then "Create."
4. Enter the user's email and verify group assignment.
5. Choose whether to send a welcome email (checkbox in the create window).
6. Click CREATE. The user appears in the Active or Invited tab depending on their activation status.

## Tips
- Use groups to manage permissions efficiently.
- Organisation users have the same management UI as regular users. See [Users](users.md) for details.
- The Invited tab lists users who have been created but not yet activated (e.g., welcome email not sent or not yet accepted).
