# Organisations

Organisations and organisation users is the best way to invite external vendors or customers into your system and allow them to view specific data only related to them. This section outlines how to create and mange new organisation groups, invite new organisation users, manage existing organisation users, and utilize various organisation related features.

## Accessing the organisations list

To manage users within the Flow platform:

1. Go to the **"Organisation"** tab in the Site Settings.
2. You'll be presented with a list of organisations.

## How organisations are structured

Organisations are created so that you first have to create or select a organisation group and then you can invite your users.

:::tip
Its generally suggested to always have a global group and a company/organisation specific group so that a user always have two organisation groups.
This way you can manage general permissions in the global group.
