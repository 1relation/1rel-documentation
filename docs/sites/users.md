# Users

A guide to managing users in FlowAgent, including creating users and handling user access.

## When to Use
Read this page when you need to add or manage users for your site.

## How It Works
- **User Types:**
  - Internal users: Full access based on group permissions.
  - External users (Organisations): Limited access, typically for customers/vendors. See [Organisations](organisations.md).
- **User States:**
  - Active: Can log in and use the site.
  - Invited: Created but not yet activated (e.g., welcome email not sent or not yet accepted).
  - Inactive: Previously had access, now disabled.

## Usage Example
**Creating a new user:**
1. Go to the Users tab in Site Settings.
2. Click "Create."
3. Enter user details and assign groups.
4. Choose whether to send a welcome email (checkbox in the create window).
5. Click CREATE. The user appears in the Active or Invited tab depending on their activation status.

**Managing users:**
- Reset password, resend welcome email, edit details, archive/reactivate as needed.

## Tips
- Use groups to control user permissions. See [Groups](groups.md).
- Only users with the right permissions can manage other users.
- The Invited tab lists users who have been created but not yet activated (e.g., welcome email not sent or not yet accepted).
