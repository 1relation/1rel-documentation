# Import

The Import feature lets you bring data from external sources into your FlowAgent modules quickly and efficiently.

## When to Use
Use Import when you need to migrate data from CSV files or bulk update items in a module.

## How It Works
- Access the Import tool from the module’s settings page (not from the main menu).
- Upload a CSV file and map columns to your module’s fields.
- Review and confirm the import to add or update items.

## Usage Example
Suppose you want to import a list of customers:

1. Go to the Customers module.
2. Click “Import” in the module settings and upload your CSV file.
3. Map the columns (e.g., Name, Email, Phone) to custom fields.
4. Confirm and complete the import.

## Tips
- Only CSV files are supported for import.
- Make sure your CSV columns match your module’s custom fields for best results.
