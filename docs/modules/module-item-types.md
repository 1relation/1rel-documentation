# Module Item Types

Module Item Types let you categorize items within a module, reducing the need for separate modules when differences are minor.

## When to Use
Use item types when you want to distinguish between different item categories (e.g., Journal, Delivery, Waste) within the same module.

## How It Works
- Define types in module settings (e.g., "Types" tab).
- Assign custom fields, tabs, and relations to each type.
- Types control which fields and tabs are visible for each item.

## Usage Example
Suppose you have an Orders module with two types: "Journal" and "Delivery".

## Creating and Configuring Types
1. Go to module settings and select "Types."
2. Click "Create" or edit an existing type.
3. Assign fields and tabs for each type.
4. Save your changes.
