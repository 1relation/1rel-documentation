# Custom Fields

Custom fields let you define and store specific information for each item in a module, such as a customer, task, or equipment.

## When to Use
Use custom fields when you need to capture unique data points for items in your modulesâ€”like names, statuses, prices, or any custom attribute.

## How It Works
- Each module can have its own set of custom fields.
- Field types include text, dropdown, date, checkbox, files, and more.
- Custom fields are used in forms, lists, and workflows throughout FlowAgent.

## Usage Example
Suppose you want to add a "Status" dropdown and a "Due Date" field to a Task module:

```json
{
  "customfields": [
    {
      "type": "dropdown",
      "label": "Status",
      "options": ["Open", "In Progress", "Done"]
    },
    {
      "type": "date",
      "label": "Due Date"
    }
  ]
}
```
