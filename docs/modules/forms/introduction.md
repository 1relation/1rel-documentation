# Forms Introduction

A concise guide to using Forms in FlowAgent for data entry, workflows, and automation.

## When to Use
Use Forms to collect, edit, or process user data, trigger workflows, or manage item lifecycles within your application.

## How It Works
- Forms consist of pages and fields, supporting multi-step data entry and advanced logic.
- Each form can include visibility rules, triggers, and custom actions.
- Forms are linked to modules, items, and workflows for seamless integration.
- Fields are highly configurable â€” see [Form Fields](/docs/modules/forms/components/pages/fields/introduction.md) for all types and options.
