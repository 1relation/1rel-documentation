# Item Trash

Item Trash lets you recover deleted items before they are permanently removed, providing a safety net for accidental deletions.

## When to Use
Use Item Trash when you want to restore deleted items or review what has been removed from a module.

## How It Works
- Deleted items are moved to the trash instead of being permanently deleted.
- Access the trash from the item list or detail view.
- Restore items from the trash or let them be permanently deleted after a set period (default: 30 days).

## Usage Example
1. Delete an item from a module.
2. Go to the trash view ("Trash" or "Deleted Items" in the menu).
3. Select the item and click "Restore" to recover it.

## Deletion Policy
- Items remain in trash for 30 days by default.
- After this period, items are permanently deleted and cannot be restored.
