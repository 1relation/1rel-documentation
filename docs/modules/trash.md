# Item Trash
Item Trash is a feature that allows you to recover items that have been deleted. When an item is deleted, it is not permanently removed from the system. Instead, it is moved to the trash, where it can be restored if needed. After a certain period, items in the trash may be permanently deleted based on the the deletion policy.

## How to Use Item Trash
To use the item trash feature, follow these steps:
1. **Delete an Item**: When you delete an item, it is moved to the trash instead of being permanently deleted.
2. **Access the Trash**: You can access the trash from the item list view or the item detail view. Look for a "Trash" or "Deleted Items" option in the menu.
3. **Restore an Item**: In the trash view, you can see all deleted items. Select the item you want to restore and click the "Restore" button. The item will be moved back to its original location.

## Deletion Policy
The deletion policy determines how long deleted items are kept in the trash before they are permanently deleted. The default policy is to keep items in the trash for 30 days. After this period, items will be permanently deleted and cannot be restored.
