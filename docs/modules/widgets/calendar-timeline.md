# Event Timeline

The Event Timeline widget allows users to visualize and track calendar events in a chronological list view. This feature helps users quickly understand when certain meetings or events have occurred, such as meetings with a specific customer. The widget provides a clean and easy-to-follow timeline, ideal for getting an overview of customer interactions and appointments.

Configuration of the Event Timeline widget is the same as the [Calendar widget](/docs/modules/widgets/calendar) (they share the same configuration).
