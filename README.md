# Documentation Writing Guidelines

## Purpose
Our documentation should be as clear, concise, and helpful as the best open-source docs (e.g., Laravel). The goal is to help users quickly understand, use, and troubleshoot the platform.

## General Principles
- **Clarity:** Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon unless defined.
- **Brevity:** Be concise. Split complex topics into multiple pages or sections.
- **Structure:** Use headings, lists, and code blocks for readability. **Do not use tables; always use lists and clear sections instead.**
- **Consistency:** Use the same terminology and formatting throughout.
- **Examples:** Every page about JSON or code must include at least one real-world example.
- **Navigation:** Link to related topics and subpages where appropriate.
- **Audience:** Write for both beginners and experienced users. Explain concepts, but donâ€™t belabor the obvious.

## Page Structure
1. **Title**
2. **Short Introduction** (1-2 sentences)
3. **When to Use** (if applicable)
4. **How It Works** (brief explanation)
5. **Usage Example(s)** (required for JSON/code pages)
6. **Options/Parameters** (if applicable)
7. **Related Links** (to other docs/pages)

## Code & JSON Examples
- Use syntax highlighting.
- Show both input and output if relevant.
- Keep examples minimal but realistic.

## Updating Existing Docs
- Break up long pages into logical subpages.
- Remove outdated or redundant information.
- Ensure every JSON/code page has an example.
- Use the above structure for every page.
- **Avoid use tables. Use lists and sections for all options and parameters.**
